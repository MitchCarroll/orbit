Ok, this is intended to eventually be a suite of astrogation utilities, libraries, and maybe even a nice GUI.
It's going to be chaotic for a bit until I get all of the algorithms and whatnot collected up, and drum up a list of tasks, and standards and such.
I really want to keep it simple. should be fairly easily embedable if possible. standard UNIX design philosophy. lots of small tools that do one thing well, etc.

at the moment, here's what i think i need for now:

astrogational almanac         -	   a set of useful constants and such stored in a simple text format that can easily be updated.
optical position plotting     -	   a utility that takes input in the form of angles relative to the observation platform, and builds a current position in cartesian coordinates.
initial orbit determination   -	   a utility that takes a limited set of position plots, and generates in initial estimate for your current orbit
orbit determination refinement-	   a utility that takes an initial orbit estimate, and refines if with new data, hopefully converging on an accurate determination
porkchop plot	    	      -	   a utility that takes two separate orbits, and generates a graph of predicted time and delta v requirements to effect a rendezvous
delta v	 		      -	   a utility that takes an initial orbit and a target orbit, and optionally a time constraint, and outputs the optimal thrust vector and delta v
